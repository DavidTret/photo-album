# Photo Album Application

This project is a console application that prints all photo ids and titles in an album, given the albumId.

The application is written in C# .NET 6.0, and unit testing is done using MSTest in Visual Studio.

## Prerequisites

.NET 6.0 must be installed to build the project and run the application.

## Build

After .NET is installed, navigate to the repo source directory and use the command "dotnet build" to build the source files and dependencies.
Alternatively, the .sln file can be opened in Visual Studio and built from that app.

## Running

The executable photo-album.exe will be placed in the bin folder either under Debug or Release depending on the build configuration.

## Testing

The included tests can be run from either Visual Studio or from the command line by navigating to the directory containing PhotoAlbumTests.dll. This file should be in the PhotoAlbumTests project under bin\Debug\net6.0.
